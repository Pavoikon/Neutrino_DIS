# Neutrino_DIS
A python code that can be used to evaluate Structure Functions and Cross-Sections for Neutrino Deep Inelastic Scattering at ***Leading Order***.

For the Structure Function evaluation, the python package [parton](https://github.com/DavidMStraub/parton) has been utilised which implements the necessary features of [LHAPF](https://www.lhapdf.org/index.html).
